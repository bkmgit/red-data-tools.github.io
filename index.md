## About Red Data Tools {#about}

Red Data Tools is a project that provides data processing tools for Ruby.

Our policies:

  1. Collaborate over Ruby community

     * We collaborate with Ruby community and other communities. For example, we use Apache Arrow that is shared with many languages and join Apache Arrow development to share benefits.

  2. Acting than blaming

     * We spend our time to write codes, test, write documentations, introduce our works, give some feedback to other projects and so on than to blame the current our situation (Python may have many good tools than Ruby), the current some library implementations and so on.

  3. Continuous small works than a temporary big work

     * We may need many works to do many data processing tasks with Ruby. We need to work continuously to archive complete tools for data processing. So continuous works are more important than a temporary work for us.

  4. The current lack of knowledge isn't matter

     * We may need knowledge about mathematics, statistics, linear algebras and so on to implement fast tools. But we don't require them when someone joins us. Because we can learn about them while we work. We can use existing fast implementations and learn from existing fast implementations.

  5. Ignore blames from outsiders

     * We may take a long time to archive complete tools for data processing. Some outsiders may blame us until the time. We ignore the blames. We don't have time to process them. :-)

  6. Fun!

     * Because we use Ruby!
